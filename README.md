## Configuration

After installing the integration, you can configure it through the Home Assistant UI. The integration offers several customization options for optimal time windows that help you find the best electricity prices for your needs.

### Configuration Options

The integration provides advanced configuration options to customize how it searches for optimal electricity price windows:

#### Cheapest Hours Search Settings

These settings control how the integration finds the most economical electricity periods:

- **Start Hour** (0-23): Beginning of the time window to search for cheapest hours
  - *Default*: 0 (midnight)
  - *Example*: Set to 22 to search from 10 PM onwards

- **End Hour** (1-24): End of the time window to search for cheapest hours  
  - *Default*: 24 (midnight next day)
  - *Example*: Set to 6 to search until 6 AM

- **Duration (hours)** (1-24): Length of the cheapest continuous time window to find
  - *Default*: 2 hours
  - *Example*: Set to 3 to find 3-hour blocks of cheapest electricity

#### Most Expensive Hours Search Settings

These settings control how the integration finds the most expensive electricity periods (useful for avoiding high-cost times):

- **Start Hour** (0-23): Beginning of the time window to search for most expensive hours
  - *Default*: 0 (midnight)
  - *Example*: Set to 16 to search from 4 PM onwards

- **End Hour** (1-24): End of the time window to search for most expensive hours
  - *Default*: 24 (midnight next day)  
  - *Example*: Set to 20 to search until 8 PM

- **Duration (hours)** (1-24): Length of the most expensive continuous time window to find
  - *Default*: 2 hours
  - *Example*: Set to 1 to find 1-hour blocks of most expensive electricity

### Reconfiguring Settings

You can modify these settings at any time:

1. Go to **Configuration** > **Integrations**
2. Find "RCE PSE" in your integrations list
3. Click **Configure** 
4. Adjust the settings as needed
5. Click **Submit** to apply changes

The integration will automatically reload with your new settings.

### Configuration Examples

**Example 1: Night Charging (Electric Vehicle)**
- Cheapest Hours: Start=22, End=6, Duration=4
- Find 4 cheapest consecutive hours between 10 PM and 6 AM

**Example 2: Business Hours Optimization**  
- Most Expensive Hours: Start=8, End=18, Duration=2
- Avoid the 2 most expensive consecutive hours during business hours

**Example 3: Peak Avoidance**
- Most Expensive Hours: Start=17, End=21, Duration=1  
- Identify the single most expensive hour during evening peak

### Additional Sensors

When you configure custom time windows, the integration provides additional sensors:

**For Today:**
- Cheapest Window Start/End/Range
- Most Expensive Window Start/End/Range

**For Tomorrow:**
- Cheapest Window Start/End/Range  
- Most Expensive Window Start/End/Range

These sensors automatically update based on your configured search parameters and provide precise time ranges in HH:MM format.

## Debugging

To enable debug logging for the RCE PSE integration, add the following to your Home Assistant `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    custom_components.rce_pse: debug
```

This will enable detailed logging for:
- Integration setup and configuration
- API requests and responses 
- Data fetching and processing
- Sensor creation and updates
- Error handling and troubleshooting

After adding this configuration, restart Home Assistant and check the logs in:
- **Configuration** > **Logs** in the Home Assistant UI
- Or directly in the `home-assistant.log` file

Debug logs include:
- PSE API request URLs and parameters
- API response status and data counts
- Configuration flow steps
- Sensor setup progress
- Coordinator data updates

## Data Source

This integration fetches data from the official PSE API:
- **API**: `https://v2.api.raporty.pse.pl/api`
- **Update Interval**: 30 minutes
- **Data Availability**: Tomorrow's prices are available after 14:00 CET
